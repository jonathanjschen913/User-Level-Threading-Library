This is a user-level threading library.

Provides cooperative and preemptive thread scheduling with features including thread creation, yielding, waiting, and synchronization primitives like locks and condition variables. 

Supports multiple scheduling algorithms (random, first-come-first-served) and includes interrupt handling for preemptive multitasking, with context switching managed using ucontext_t.
